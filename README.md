# MedCreds

MedCreds, developed by and contributed to LFPH by ProofMarket, allows medical authorities to directly issue test and vaccination results in the form of verifiable credentials to individuals in a digital wallet. Wallet holders can also request peer-to-peer credentials from others using the MedCreds system. MedCreds had its initial implementation in the film industry, allowing compliance officers to verify workers’ COVID test results with their consent before they come on site.
